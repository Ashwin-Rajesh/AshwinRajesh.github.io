# RC Discharge Water Analogy

Our brains are not really made to comprehend the differential equations and math underlying even basic electrical networks. So, these are not very intuitive at first sight. To get an "intuitive" understanding, we have 2 ways

1) Use analogies with physical phenomena we are familiar with

2) Practice problems and analyze circuits and train your brain

One of the most intuitive ways to look at basic concepts of electricity is using water or fluids. After all, voltage is like a force acting on electrons that make them move. This is similar to water pressure differences causing movement in fluids

Here I have tried to demostrate the analogy of a simple capacitor discharging and a water tank being emptied.

The discharging is determined by the equation

$$ V_C + C.\frac{dV_C}{dt} = V_inp $$
